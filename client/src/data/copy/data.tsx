They are: avalanche, coastal flooding, cold wave, drought, hail, heat wave, hurricane, ice storm, landslide, riverine flooding, strong wind, tornado, wildfire, and winter weather. The rate is calculated by dividing the agricultural value at risk by the total agricultural value.';

They are: avalanche, coastal flooding, cold wave, drought, hail, heat wave, hurricane, ice storm, landslide, riverine flooding, strong wind, tornado, wildfire, and winter weather. The rate is calculated by dividing the building value at risk by the total building value.';

They are: avalanche, coastal flooding, cold wave, drought, hail, heat wave, hurricane, ice storm, landslide, riverine flooding, strong wind, tornado, wildfire, and winter weather. Population loss is reported as the number of fatalities and injuries caused by a hazard as defined by the Spatial Hazard Events and Losses and National Centers for Environmental Information’s (NCEI).';

  'A high precision, climate-adjusted model that projects flood risk for properties in the future. The dataset calculates how many properties are at risk of floods occurring in the next thirty years from tides, rain, riverine and storm surges, or a 26% risk total over the 30-year time horizon. The risk is defined as an annualized 1% chance. The tool calculates tract-level risk as the share of properties meeting the risk threshold. The risk does not consider property value.';

  'A 30-meter resolution model projecting the wildfire exposure for any specific location in the contiguous U.S., today and with future climate change. The risk of wildfire is calculated from inputs associated with fire fuels, weather, human influence, and fire movement. The risk does not consider property value.';
